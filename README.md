# 🎶 QMusic: Quantum-Generated Music with Qiskit

QMusic is a creative project that explores the intersection of **quantum computing** and **music generation**. Using Qiskit, this project generates music patterns by encoding musical structures into quantum circuits and interpreting the results as musical notes.

Each Python script corresponds to a different instrument track, allowing experimentation with layered quantum-composed music.
